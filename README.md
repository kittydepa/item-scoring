# item-scoring
That 1 (or second) time I tried to learn JavaScript with a mentor. <br>

The purpose of this program was to:
1. Create mock test score data for several psychological screening tests, (to practice scoring)
2. Score the mock data, where the score equals the sum of all the screening tests, to give a composite score that determines level of severity in terms of mental illness.
